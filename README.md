Trying to clone https://ftx.us/markets

======================================
this end point doesnt have daily percentage change, that's why I opted for CoinMarketCap
https://docs.coinapi.io/?javascript#list-all-assets-get

======================================
https://react-financial.github.io/react-financial-charts/?path=/docs/features-axis--y-axis
to style chart

=========================================
this does not work. error. Trying to get a list of all the symbols aka tickers they use because they are different from coin market cap.
https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/symbols/
coin market cap (cmc) costs $95 for 1 month to get open high low close (ohlc) data.
in coinapi it's free but their symbols are different than cmc.
